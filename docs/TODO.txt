Package: Kippo-Graph
Version: 0.9
Author: ikoniaris
Website: bruteforce.gr/kippo-graph


TODO for new versions:
+ Seperate HTML and PHP where possible, tidy up code!
+ Use new version of QGoogleVisualAPI and generate more graphs (eg GeoMap instead of IntensityMap?)
+ Include sample Apache configuration (unless uploaded to /var/www/)
+ 2nd tab on Intensity Map (or new map) with successes per country (temporary SQL table/query)
+ Add option to show results only from a particular sensor (add value in config.php and then change the SQL queries? Perhaps move all SQL query strings in seperate file)
+ Option to use local/offline geolocation service and not geoplugin, see: https://www.maxmind.com/app/support
+ Proxy detection resurrection, here are some lists: https://github.com/lfamorim/barrelroll/tree/master/full_list
+ Table with returning attackers (Kippo-Input). If username/password in auth table exists in userdb.txt then he logged in again (apart from the defaults).
+ Integrate or offer as seperate utility the VirusTotal uploader by @0xAli (contact him again for file)
+ Add www.ip-adress.com/whois/<IP> in Kippo-Geo for IPs (limit of 50 lookups per day is OK) 
+ Use convert/save as ZIP file API from online-convert.com in Kippo-Input for downloaded files
+ Integrate Kippo-Playlog as seen here: http://194.213.0.254/secure/kippo-playlog.php and Kippo-Auth as seen here: http://chaosberlin.de/kippo-graph/kippo-auth.php
+ Kippo-Input: downloaded files with curl (curl -O <file>)


DONE:
+ Add CSV dump/backup function
+ Graphs (.png) creation should be moved to xxx-generator for each component (or all in one!)
+ Move project to sf.net/googlecode.com/github.com (next milestone version)
+ Show basic stats like number of attacks, number of IPs, total commands, etc --OK--
+ Fix XSS in Kippo-Input --OK--
+ Human activity per week, Successes per day (line), Probing busiest days (Top 20), naming conventions/changes, update gallery. --OK--
+ URGENT: Fix "Successful logins from same IP", "Probes per day", "Successes per day", when the DB is very big. See: http://t.co/TltEfH89 --OK--
+ Successes per week graph, so gallery will look complete :P --OK--
+ Add timestamp to command tables --OK--
+ New table for passwd and various commands --OK--
+ Generate and post CHECKSUMS for the tar archive online --OK--
+ Include a license file. libchart is GPL, QGoogleVisualAPI is BSD 2-Clause (aka Modified BSD aka FreeBSD), 
	geoplugin is free asks for recognition - OK,
	web template has its own license that requires link at the bottom - OK, 
	honeycomb image in the logo requires attribution - OK, 
	so Kippo-Graph license => GPL, mentioning all the others seperately,
